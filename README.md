## Design Choices
### Font
#### (/media/readme-images/fonts.png)
+ Primary font 'Arial' was chosen for the main text of the site because of it clear readability, clean style and complementary contrast with the secondary font. This font also looks good in uppercase with a little extra letter spacing, and so could serve nicely as a sub heading as well.
+ The secondary font 'Permanent Marker' was chosen for the site name as it helps site name to stand out, but yet keep that simplicity.
### Icons
+ In order to keep the site uncluttered only a few icons were utilized.
### (/media/readme-images/nav-icons.png)
+ The search icon, shopping cart and user icons were used in the navigation bar as they are conventionally used in this setting and would be what the user expects to see.
+ If the user is logged in as Admin, user icon is changing to njinja user icon
### (/media/readme-images/nav-icons.png)
+ The Facebook and Yelp logo icon is included in the footer to lead visitors to Bee Cycles facebook and Yelp page.
### (/media/readme-images/products-icons.png)
+ Euro icon was used as currency, Tag icon was used for Category, star as a product rating, and some basic edit and delete icons.
### ### (/media/readme-images/quantity-icons.png)
+ Basic plus and minus icons were used for quantity.
### Colours
### (/media/readme-images/quantity-icons.png)
+ Orange: #FFC107
+ Smoky White: #E3E1E1
+ Dark Grey: #343A40
+ Black: #000000
+ Above colour palette was chosen based on owners chosen logo and catchy site name, so I've decided to keep everything in those colours.
### Styling
+ Curved cornes were applied on Buttons and Product cards.
+ Text shaddow and brightness were applied on Category cards on Home Page to make text more easier to read. 
### Wireframes
#### These wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) during the Scope Plane part of the design and planning process for this project.
